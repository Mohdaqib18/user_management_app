# user_management_app
Role based authentication management app

You'll need to have node installed on your computer. 

Download the Repo, and run the following command at the root of the repo:

npm install
npm run dev

This should open up the localhost. This project is currently working only for port 5174. As the project is in development, we have had to hardcode the port in the Auth0 admin dashboard.
