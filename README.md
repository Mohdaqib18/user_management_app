# user_management_app
Role based authentication management app

Instructions to Get the Server Running on Local
-----------------------------------------------------
1) Download the User Management Server From https://github.com/Mohdaqib18/user_management_server
2) Run npm run dev at the root of the downloaded directory
3) If you want to try the /users endpoint to get a response from the server  - you can do so by entering http://localhost:8000/users

Instructions to Get The App Working on Local
------------------------------------------------------
1) Download the React App for Client from: https://github.com/Mohdaqib18/user_management_app
2) Run npm install, followed by npm run dev at the root of the client app
3) Client will start running on http://localhost:5173 or http://localhost:5174

You'll need to run the server before the client app is run. To deploy to production, we just need to get a custom domain, change the allowed urls with this custom domain in auth0 dashboard, and host the client and server on a cloud hosting solution.
